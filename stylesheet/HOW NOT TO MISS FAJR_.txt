Bimillah....

         Fajr (The islamic prayer performed before the sunrise) is undoubtedly the most difficult salah to establish not only for hypocrites but also to people with a good imaan too, na aauzobillah. Our sleep is the villain that we need to defeat here.

         Here I list some actions that when performed would enable you, me or anyone to win that war against sleep and establish a timely Fajr, with the Jamaath and with 2 rakats of its fore sunnah.


         1. Go early to bed (Ok cliche!)

         We all know this, but how many of us implement it? In this present world where night life seems so attractive, added with the advent of smartphone apps that keep us hooked, sleeping early has just become more difficult than ever; astaghfirullah.

         Make a plan; do all that you need to do before 10 PM in the night, avoid the irrelevant, seek allahs protection from the addictive, and go to sleep before 10. Just go to sleep. For Allah's messenger Prophet Muhammad pbuh disliked speaking after the salah of Isha. 

         If you are reading this after 10, I recommend that you stroll through it quickly, create an alarm for Fajr and go to sleep.


         2. Make a strong Niyaah ( Intention ) that you will difinitely wake up for the Fajr before sleeping.


         3. Create alarm such that it rings exactly at the time of azaan.


         4. Don't forget the reward for performing. 


         5. Don't forger the puninshment for missing.


         6. Create an ambience where you are not the only person who prays.


         7. Supplicate to Allah swt.


         Tips: * Read Ayat al kursi before sleep.
               * Keep the alarm a little far away from you.
               * Remember death much.
