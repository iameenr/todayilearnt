Do we give enough time for Rukoo and Sujoods?




How to do rukoo’ 

73-            He should put his hands on his knees, firmly, spacing the fingers out, as if he is grasping his knees.

74-            He should spread his back and make it level so that if water were poured on it, it would stay there (not run off).

75-            He should not lower or raise his head, but make it level with his back.

76-            He should keep his elbows away from his sides.

77-            In rukoo’, he should say “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord, the Almighty) three times or more. There are others kinds of dhikr which may be said in rukoo’, some of which are long, some of medium length and some short. See Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), p. 132, Maktabat al-Ma’aarif edition [The Prophet’s Prayer Described, p. 44]. 

Making the essential parts of prayer equal in length  

78-            It is Sunnah to make the essential parts of prayer equal in length, so the rukoo’, the standing after rukoo’, the prostration and the sitting between the two prostrations should be make approximately the same in length.

79-            It is not permissible to recite Qur’aan in rukoo’ or in sujood. 

Straightening up from rukoo’ 

80-            Then he should straighten up from rukoo’. This is an essential part of the prayer.

81-            Whilst straightening up, he should say, “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah (Allaah listens to the one who praises Him).” This is obligatory.

82-            He should raise his hands when straightening up, in the manner described above.

83-            Then he should stand straight until every vertebra has returned to its place. This is an essential part of the prayer.

84-            Whilst standing thus, he should say, “Rabbanaa wa laka al-hamd (our Lord, to You be all praise).” (There are other kinds of dhikr which may be said at this point. See Sifat al-Salaah, p. 135/The Prophet’s prayer described, p. 47). This is obligatory for every person who is praying, even if he is following an imaam, because this is the dhikr of standing after rukoo’, and saying “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah” is the dhikr of straightening up from rukoo’. It is not prescribed to put the hands one over the other during this standing, because this was not narrated (from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). For more details, see Sifat Salaat al-Nabi, 1 – Istiqbaal al-Qiblah (The Prophet’s Prayer Described – Facing the Ka’bah).

85-            He should make this standing equal in length to the rukoo’, as stated above. 

7 – Sujood (prostration) 

86-            Then he should say “Allaahu akbar” – this is obligatory.

87-            He should raise his hands sometimes. 

Going down on the hands 

88-            Then he should go down into sujood on his hands, putting them down before the knees. This is what was commanded by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it is proven that he did this, and he forbade imitating the manner in which a camel sits down, which is by kneeling with its forelegs first. [this appears to contradict the point he is trying to make]

89-            When he prostrates – which is an essential part of the prayer – he should put his weight on his palms and spread them out.

90-            He should keep the fingers together.

91-            And point the fingers towards the qiblah.

92-            He should put his palms level with his shoulders.

93-            Sometimes he should make them level with his ears.

94-            He should keep his forearms off the ground. This is obligatory. He should not spread them along the ground like a dog.

95-            He should place his nose and forehead firmly on the ground. This is an essential part of the prayer.

96-            He should also place his knees firmly on the ground.

97-            The same applies to his toes.

98-            He should hold his feet upright with his toes touching the ground. All of this is obligatory.

99-            He should make his toes point in the direction of the qiblah.

100-        He should put his heels together. 

Being at ease in sujood 

101-        He should be at ease in sujood, distributing his weight equally [?] on the parts of the body which should be in contact with the ground during sujood. They are: the nose and forehead, the palms, the knees, and the toes.

102-        Whoever is at ease in his sujood in this manner has got it right. And this being at ease is also an essential part of the prayer.

103-        In sujood, he should say, “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘A’laa (Glory be to my Lord Most High)” three times or more. (There are other kinds of dhikr also, see Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), p. 145/The Prophet’s Prayer described, p. 55).

104-        It is mustahaab to offer a lot of du’aa’ during sujood, because it is a time when du’aa’ is likely to be answered.

105-        He should make his sujood almost as long as his rukoo’, as described above.

106-        It is permissible to prostrate on the bare ground, or on something covering the ground such as a garment or carpet, or a mat, etc.

107-        It is not permitted to recite Qur’aan whilst prostrating.
